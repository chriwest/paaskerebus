"In a land far, far away, there was a wise old astronomer who spent his days studying the heavens. One day, while observing the night sky, he discovered a secret location on Earth that held an extraordinary secret.

To share the knowledge of this secret location, the astronomer left a cryptic message in his diary:

Four children were playing hide-and-seek. They decided to search for the best hiding spots. The first child found a small room with 40 drawers, while the second hid behind 25 books neatly placed on a shelf. The third child climbed up a tree with 2 branches, and the last child hid inside a giant barrel that could hold 500 gallons of water.

Meanwhile, their parents were preparing a grand feast. The mother cooked 58 dishes, and the father opened 43 bottles of wine to celebrate the occasion. As they sat down at the table, they found 9 plates missing and 7 forks misplaced."

Where is this extraordinary secret?
